# Root environment example for local development
#
# This file is intentionally minimal. Most services keep their own .env.example
# under apps/<service>/. Copy and customize per service.
#
# Common variables that some tooling may read:
# ENV=dev
# REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
# PROMETHEUS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:9090
# SENTRY_DSN=
